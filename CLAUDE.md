# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

**Boardly** is a native iOS SwiftUI client for any self-hosted [PLANKA](https://github.com/plankanban/planka) instance. It has no backend of its own — the app talks directly to the user's PLANKA server over REST (and Socket.IO for real-time updates). It must support multiple server profiles (one user, many PLANKA instances).

The canonical API reference is `Reference/planka-openapi.json` (OpenAPI 3.0). **Always derive models from this file**, not from Postman docs or guesswork.

The work is split into phases — see `ROADMAP.md` for the execution plan and the suggested kickoff prompt for each phase.

**The spec is a starting point, not the truth.** Live instances outrun it, and the two editions (community / Pro) don't send the same fields. When a decode fails, profile the real payload rather than trusting `planka-openapi.json` — an audit of every model against the spec found zero problems while the Pro instance was breaking the projects screen. See Phase 9 in `ROADMAP.md` for the field-level snapshot.

## Architecture rules

### BoardlyKit (SPM module)
- Pure Swift — no UIKit, no SwiftUI
- REST networking: `URLSession` + `async/await` only (no Alamofire)
- Real-time: a Socket.IO client library is the **one allowed third-party dependency**, scoped strictly to the real-time sync layer — do not introduce other third-party dependencies for REST, auth, or models
- Token storage: **Keychain only** — never `UserDefaults`
- Tokens are scoped per server profile (keyed by the base URL or a stable profile ID)
- Tests must be possible via a mockable `URLSession` protocol; no real network in tests

### Boardly (SwiftUI app)
- Views hold **no business logic** — all logic lives in `@Observable` view models or BoardlyKit
- State pattern: **MV (Model-View)** — `@Observable` view models injected explicitly, no singletons passed through the environment unless it is a top-level app-wide store (e.g. `ProfileStore`)
- Navigation: `NavigationStack` with a path-based router; no sheet-only navigation for primary flows
- Multi-instance from day one: every API call (REST and Socket.IO) goes through a `PlankaClient` instance bound to a specific server profile, never a global client

### Data flow
- `GET /boards/{id}` returns an `included` sideloaded payload — parse lists, cards, and tasks from there; **never** make one network call per card/task
- Real-time: subscribe to the board's Socket.IO event stream while it is open to keep lists/cards/tasks in sync live; pull-to-refresh remains as a manual fallback/recovery mechanism (e.g. after reconnecting)
- The Socket.IO connection is per server profile and must be torn down when leaving a board or switching profiles — never kept alive across profiles

> ✅ **Resolved deviation (was Phase 4):** the Projects list shows "N cards" per board, and there is no lightweight PLANKA count endpoint (`Board` carries no count field — only `GET /boards/{id}` returns a full payload). It previously fetched **every** board's payload concurrently on load (`loadCardCounts`) — a request burst on large instances. Fixed in `ProjectListView.swift`: the list is a `LazyVStack` and each board row loads its count **on appear** (`loadCardCount(_:using:)`, cached per session), so only visible rows fetch. This full-payload-per-count is still heavier than ideal but is now bounded to what's on screen — do not reintroduce the eager burst, and do not copy even the lazy pattern to hot paths where a lighter call exists.

---

## Logging

Use `BoardlyLog` (in `BoardlyKit`) for all diagnostic output. Never use `print`, `NSLog`, or raw `os_log` directly.

```swift
BoardlyLog.tag(.network).icon("📡").info("Request started", metadata: ["url": url])
BoardlyLog.tag(.auth).warning("Token expiring soon")
BoardlyLog.tag(.network).icon("⚠️").error("Request failed", error: error, metadata: ["url": url])
```

**Redaction rule (non-negotiable):** Any metadata value that could be a token, password, or API key must be wrapped in `Redacted(...)`. The wrapper discards the real value at init and emits `"<redacted>"` — making it structurally impossible for a secret to reach the log sink in plaintext.

```swift
// Correct
BoardlyLog.tag(.auth).info("Logged in", metadata: ["token": Redacted(jwt)])

// Never do this — caught by security-patterns.yaml
print("token: \(jwt)")
```

Available tags: `.auth` `.network` `.profile` `.sync` `.board` `.ui`

In tests, swap `BoardlyLog.sink` for a `TestLogSink` (defined in `BoardlyLogTests.swift`) to capture log entries without writing to `os_log`. Restore the previous sink in `tearDown`.

---

## Localization

Boardly ships an English **String Catalog** (`Boardly/Boardly/Localizable.xcstrings`,
base language `en`) with French as a translated locale. The catalog is the **single
source of truth**; every user-facing string must be localizable.

**The one rule:** any text shown to a user is a `LocalizedStringKey` /
`LocalizedStringResource` — **never a bare `String`.** `Text("…")`, `Button("…")`,
`Label("…", …)`, `.navigationTitle("…")` already do this — stay on that path. A
literal silently leaves the catalog the moment it flows through a `String`, so the
rules below close every such escape.

### 1. Component copy params are `LocalizedStringKey`, never `String`

*Data* a component renders (a card name, a field value) is a separate `String`
param shown with `Text(verbatim:)`.

```swift
// Correct
struct SettingRow: View { let title: LocalizedStringKey; let value: String }
Text(title)             // localized copy
Text(verbatim: value)   // data — never localized

// Never — a String copy param opts every call site out of the catalog
struct SettingRow: View { let title: String }
```

### 2. Never assemble user-facing sentences by concatenation/interpolation into a `String`

One localized format string per phrase, so translators own word order and grammar.

```swift
Text("updated \(date.formatted(.relative(presentation: .named)))")   // key: "updated %@"
// Never: build the phrase as a String, then Text(thatString)
```

### 3. Counts use catalog plurals

Not `"\(n) item\(n == 1 ? "" : "s")"`. Write `Text("\(n) cards")` /
`String(localized: "\(n) cards")` and give the key `one`/`other` variants per locale
— English `+"s"` never pluralises French (`tableaux`, not `tableaus`).

### 4. Enums separate the stored value from the display name

`rawValue` is a persistence/API identifier and is **never shown**; expose
`var localizedName: LocalizedStringResource`.

```swift
enum BoardViewMode: String { case kanban, list, grid
    var localizedName: LocalizedStringResource {
        switch self { case .kanban: "Kanban"; case .list: "List"; case .grid: "Grid" } } }
Text(mode.localizedName)          // not Text(mode.rawValue)
```

### 5. Error copy is localized in the app layer

BoardlyKit stays UI-string-free (see Architecture rules): it surfaces **typed errors
/ PLANKA error codes**; the **app** maps them to `LocalizedStringResource`. Never show
one of our own thrown errors' `localizedDescription` as final copy — map the code.
(OS/URLSession `localizedDescription` is already localized by iOS.)

### Never localize (keep verbatim)

Server/user data (project/board/list/card/label/member names, descriptions, comments,
usernames), technical identifiers (SF Symbol names, PLANKA API field values, URLs,
Keychain/UserDefaults keys, API/persistence `rawValue`s), and proper nouns (Boardly,
PLANKA, Markdown, HTML, WYSIWYG, TLS, SMTP, OIDC).

### Adding a string

Write it as a `LocalizedStringKey` (`Text("…")`, `String(localized: "…")`) —
extraction is automatic on build. Refresh the catalog from the CLI (Xcode's IDE does
this on build, but `xcodebuild` does not write it back):

```bash
xcodebuild … build     # emits .stringsdata under DerivedData
xcrun xcstringstool sync Boardly/Boardly/Localizable.xcstrings --stringsdata <each .stringsdata>
```

then add the `fr` value. Strings that reach the UI via a **dynamic**
`LocalizedStringKey(var)` (e.g. an enum name) aren't auto-extracted — add those keys
to the catalog by hand.

### Verification

Run the app under the **accented pseudolanguage** (`-AppleLanguages "(en-XA)"`): every
catalog string renders accented, so anything still plain English on screen is a leak
(fix it) or server data (leave it). **CI blocks** on: (a) any catalog key missing its
`fr` value or left `stale`/`needs_review`, and (b) the divergent patterns above
(`Text(x.rawValue)` / `Text(x.label)`, `String` copy params on view components,
concatenated `+"s"` plurals). Pseudolocalization is the definitive net.

## Authentication

- Login: `POST /access-tokens` with `emailOrUsername` + `password` → JWT, **or** via OIDC/SSO using `POST /access-tokens/exchange-with-oidc`
- Store JWT in Keychain keyed to the profile's base URL
- On 401: clear the stored token and route back to that profile's login screen
- PLANKA supports subpath hosting (e.g. `https://example.com/planka`), so the base URL is user-supplied — validate the instance responds before showing the login form
- Self-signed certificates: surface an explicit "trust this certificate" warning UI; **do not disable ATS globally or silently bypass TLS errors**

---

## PLANKA error codes

PLANKA returns structured errors. Map these centrally in `BoardlyKit`:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `E_UNAUTHORIZED` | 401 — token expired or missing |
| `E_FORBIDDEN` | 403 — insufficient permissions |
| `E_NOT_FOUND` | 404 |
| `E_CONFLICT` | 409 |
| `E_MISSING_OR_INVALID_PARAMS` | 422 |

## V1 scope

**In scope:**
- Add / select server profile, login (password or OIDC/SSO), logout, remove profile
- Projects → boards list (`GET /projects`, board list from project payload)
- Board detail: lists and cards from `GET /boards/{id}` `included` payload
- Real-time sync of boards/lists/cards/tasks via Socket.IO, with pull-to-refresh as fallback
- Create card, edit card (name, description, dueDate, move between lists via `listId`)
- View / create tasks inside a card's task list; toggle `isCompleted`
- Labels: create, assign, and remove labels on cards
- Attachments: add and view attachments (file or link) on cards
- Comments: add and view comments on cards
- Custom fields: create/manage custom field groups and fields, set values on cards
- Notifications: view in-app notifications, mark as read; manage notification services
- Board backgrounds: set/change a board's background image
- Admin config: webhooks management and instance config (SMTP, etc.) where the authenticated user has admin rights

**Explicitly out of scope — do not implement:**
- Trello import
