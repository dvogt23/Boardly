# Boardly — Macro Roadmap (9 phases)

Each phase is meant to be one (or a few) separate Claude Code session(s).
Phases are ordered by dependency: each one builds on what the previous
phase shipped and tested. Don't start a phase until the previous one builds
and passes `swift test`.

Suggested branch per phase: `feat/<phase-slug>` (see Git branch conventions
in CLAUDE.md). Squash-merge to `main` before starting the next phase.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation: BoardlyKit core + multi-instance auth

**Goal:** the bedrock every other phase depends on. No UI polish needed yet,
just a working, tested core.

- `Package.swift` + `Sources/BoardlyKit` scaffolding
- Download/commit `Reference/planka-openapi.json`, generate `Codable` models
- REST client (`URLSession` + `async/await`), scoped per server profile
- Keychain storage wrapper, scoped per profile
- Server profile management (add / switch / remove), base URL validation
  (including subpath support)
- Password login (`POST /access-tokens`) — **OIDC/SSO comes later (Phase 5)**
- 401 handling → re-route to that profile's login
- Central `PlankaAPIError` mapping (`E_UNAUTHORIZED`, `E_FORBIDDEN`, etc.)
- Minimal onboarding UI: add server, log in, switch profile

**Testing expectations:** unit tests (mocked `URLSession`) for the REST
client's request building and error mapping, the Keychain wrapper, profile
add/switch/remove logic, and model decoding against
`Reference/planka-openapi.json` fixtures. This is the highest-priority test
coverage in the whole project — it's the foundation everything else trusts.

**Suggested kickoff prompt:**
> Read CLAUDE.md. Implement Phase 1 of ROADMAP.md: BoardlyKit scaffolding,
> models from the OpenAPI spec, the REST client, Keychain-backed multi-instance
> auth (password login only), and a minimal onboarding UI. Include unit tests per
> the "Testing expectations" in ROADMAP.md. Plan first, then implement.

---

## Phase 2 — Core kanban loop (the actual app)

**Goal:** a genuinely usable kanban client, REST-only, no real-time yet.

- Projects → boards list
- Board detail: lists + cards parsed from `GET /boards/{id}` `included` payload
- Create / edit card (name, description, dueDate, move between lists)
- Tasks inside a card's task list, toggle `isCompleted`
- Pull-to-refresh
- Basic navigation (`NavigationStack`, path-based router)

**Testing expectations:** unit tests for parsing the `included` payload into
lists/cards/tasks, for the view models driving card/task CRUD (mocked
BoardlyKit client, no real network), and for the move-between-lists logic.

**Suggested kickoff prompt:**
> Read CLAUDE.md and ROADMAP.md. Implement Phase 2: the core boards/lists/cards/tasks
> screens and CRUD, on top of the Phase 1 foundation. REST + pull-to-refresh only,
> no Socket.IO yet. Include unit tests per the "Testing expectations" in ROADMAP.md.
> Plan first, then implement.

---

## Phase 3 — Real-time sync (Socket.IO)

**Goal:** layer live updates on top of the already-working Phase 2 loop.

- Add the Socket.IO client dependency (the one allowed exception to "no
  third-party deps" in BoardlyKit)
- Per-profile connection lifecycle: connect when a board is open, disconnect
  on leaving the board or switching profiles
- Subscribe to board events → update lists/cards/tasks live
- Reconnection handling; pull-to-refresh stays as the manual fallback

**Testing expectations:** unit tests for event handling and state
reconciliation (mocked socket transport, not a real connection), and for
the connect/disconnect lifecycle tied to profile switching and leaving a
board.

**Suggested kickoff prompt:**
> Read CLAUDE.md and ROADMAP.md. Implement Phase 3: Socket.IO real-time sync for
> the board screen built in Phase 2, including reconnection handling and correct
> per-profile connection lifecycle. Include unit tests per the "Testing expectations"
> in ROADMAP.md. Plan first, then implement.

---

## Phase 4 — Rich card content ✅ (custom fields split out → Phase 7)

**Goal:** everything that "hangs off" a card, building on Phase 2's card screen.

**Shipped** (merged in `main` via PR #5):

- Labels: create, assign, remove on cards
- Members: assign / remove board members on cards
- Comments: add, view, delete on cards
- Attachments: add (file / photo / link), view on cards (multipart upload)
- Chrono (stopwatch): start / stop, live-ticking elapsed time
- Activity: per-card action feed (author-attributed)

**Deferred out of this phase → now Phase 7:**

- Custom fields: manage custom field groups/fields, set values on cards

**Testing expectations:** unit tests for model decoding of labels,
comments, attachments (and the realtime reconciler for each), plus the view
models managing them on the card detail screen.

**Suggested kickoff prompt:**
> Read CLAUDE.md and ROADMAP.md. Implement Phase 4: labels, members, comments,
> attachments, chrono, and the activity feed on the card detail screen. Include
> unit tests per the "Testing expectations" in ROADMAP.md. Plan first, then implement.

---

## Phase 5 — Account & instance administration

**Goal:** the remaining account-level and admin-level features. Good last
phase since it touches settings/admin screens rather than the core loop.

- OIDC/SSO login (`POST /access-tokens/exchange-with-oidc`), alongside the
  existing password login from Phase 1
- Notifications: in-app list, mark as read; manage notification services
- Board backgrounds: set/change a board's background image
- Admin config: webhooks management, instance config (SMTP, etc.) — only
  exposed when the authenticated user has admin rights

**Testing expectations:** unit tests for the OIDC token-exchange flow
(mocked), notification list/mark-as-read logic, and the admin-rights gating
that decides whether admin screens are shown at all.

> The notification data/logic built here is *surfaced* by the **Activité** tab
> and the **Profil → Notifications** settings screen in Phase 6; keep the
> BoardlyKit-side model + view model reusable by both.

**Suggested kickoff prompt:**
> Read CLAUDE.md and ROADMAP.md. Implement Phase 5: OIDC/SSO login, notifications,
> board backgrounds, and admin config screens (gated on admin rights). Include unit
> tests per the "Testing expectations" in ROADMAP.md. Plan first, then implement.

---

## Phase 6 — App shell: TabBar + Recherche / Activité / Profil

**Goal:** the top-level navigation shell and the three remaining root tabs from
the design (screens 11–13). Ties together data already built in earlier phases
(notifications from Phase 5, profiles/auth from Phase 1) behind a persistent
TabBar. It's app-level chrome rather than the core loop.

- **TabBar shell:** persistent bottom tab bar — Projets · Recherche · Activité ·
  Profil — with an unread badge dot on the Activité tab. Projets is the existing
  projects→boards flow re-parented under the first tab.
- **Recherche tab** (screen 12): a search field + scope chips (Tout / Cartes /
  Boards / Projets); results grouped by type with match highlighting
  (card → project · list; board → project · N cartes; project). Drives the
  existing detail navigation. Decide REST search endpoint vs. client-side filter
  of loaded data (check `Reference/planka-openapi.json` for a search endpoint).
- **Activité tab** (screen 11): the notification/activity feed from Phase 5,
  grouped by recency (Aujourd'hui / Cette semaine), author-attributed with
  action text + context + relative time + unread dot; "Tout lire" (mark all read).
- **Profil tab** (screen 13): current-user header (avatar, name, @username,
  org · role); **Préférences** (Apparence, Vue d'accueil, Éditeur Markdown —
  backed by PLANKA user prefs like `defaultEditorMode` / `defaultHomeView`);
  **Compte & serveur** (Notifications → the Phase 5 notification-services screen,
  Serveur → active profile + switch); **Se déconnecter**; version footer
  ("Boardly x.y · Planka a.b").

**Testing expectations:** unit tests for the search view model (scope filtering
+ result grouping/ranking), the activity feed grouping (recency buckets +
read/unread), and the profile view model (preference read/write, logout, server
switch).

**Suggested kickoff prompt:**
> Read CLAUDE.md and ROADMAP.md. Implement Phase 6: the TabBar app shell and the
> Recherche, Activité, and Profil tabs (design screens 11–13), reusing the Phase 5
> notifications data and the Phase 1 profile/auth layer. Include unit tests per the
> "Testing expectations" in ROADMAP.md. Plan first, then implement.

---

## Phase 7 — Custom fields

**Goal:** the one piece of rich card content deferred out of Phase 4 — reading
and writing custom-field **values** on cards, plus board-level group management.

### Current state (already shipped — do NOT redo)

- The **4 models** are complete DTOs in `Sources/BoardlyKit/Models/`:
  `BaseCustomFieldGroup`, `CustomFieldGroup`, `CustomField`, `CustomFieldValue`.
- **Project/base level is done** (PR #12): `ProjectsPayload` sideloads
  `baseCustomFieldGroups` + `customFields` (accessors `baseGroups(for:)`,
  `fields(in:)`); `PlankaClient` has `createBaseCustomFieldGroup` / `update` /
  `delete` + `createBaseCustomField`; the **"Custom Fields" tab in
  `EditProjectSheet`** is a functional base-group CRUD editor.

### ⚠️ Scope correction — NO typed fields

This PLANKA version's `CustomField` has **no `type`** — a value is just a
`content` **string (≤512 chars)**. The design mockups show type chips
(Liste/Nombre/Date/Texte) but those are **decorative on the field definition
only**. Do **not** build typed inputs (number/date/dropdown/checkbox): the value
UI is a **free-text field per custom field**. Clearing the text deletes the value.

### Part A — BoardlyKit foundation (back only, not mockup-driven)

- **`BoardPayload`** does NOT currently decode custom fields (confirmed absent —
  not "present-but-ignored"). Add, mirroring `labels`/`attachments`:
  stored `customFieldGroups` / `customFields` / `customFieldValues` +
  `init` params; the 3 optional arrays in the private `Included` struct in
  `BoardPayload+Decode.swift`; accessors `customFieldGroups(for board:)`,
  `fields(in group:)`, `value(card:field:group:)`.
- **`PlankaClient`** board/card + value endpoints (same `struct Body/Response{item}`
  + `buildRequest` pattern as `createLabel`/`addCardLabel`):
  - `createBoardCustomFieldGroup` → `POST /boards/{boardId}/custom-field-groups`
    body `{position, baseCustomFieldGroupId?, name?}` (one of the two)
  - `updateCustomFieldGroup` `PATCH /custom-field-groups/{id}`;
    `deleteCustomFieldGroup` `DELETE /custom-field-groups/{id}`
  - `createCustomFieldInGroup` `POST /custom-field-groups/{groupId}/custom-fields`
    body `{name, position, showOnFrontOfCard?}`; `updateCustomField` /
    `deleteCustomField` on `/custom-fields/{id}`
  - `setCustomFieldValue` → **PATCH** (upsert)
    `/cards/{cardId}/custom-field-values/customFieldGroupId:{gid}:customFieldId:${fid}`
    body `{content}`
  - `clearCustomFieldValue` → **DELETE**
    `/cards/{cardId}/custom-field-value/customFieldGroupId:{gid}:customFieldId:${fid}`
  - ⚠️ **URL gotchas**: literal `$` before `{customFieldId}`; set uses **plural**
    `custom-field-values`, clear uses **singular** `custom-field-value`.
- **Tests** (mirror `PlankaClientProjectEditTests` / `RichCardPayloadTests`):
  board `included` decode of the 3 collections + request-building per method.

### Part B — Realtime (back only)

Mirror the **label** pattern (full record, not partial) in
`Sources/BoardlyKit/Realtime/`:
- `BoardRealtimeEvent`: `customFieldGroup`/`customField`/`customFieldValue`
  `Created/Updated/Deleted` cases; add the PLANKA event strings to `handledNames`;
  `parse` uses `item(T.self)` (create/update) / `id()` (delete).
- `BoardPayload+Reconcile.applying(_:)`: 3×3 merge cases (`upsert` / `map`-replace
  / `removeAll`). Tests for the reconciler per event.
- ⚠️ **Verify the exact socket event names on a live PLANKA instance**
  (`todo.2rock.fr`) before freezing `handledNames` — same caveat as Phase 3.

### Part C — Card value UI (the core; mockups 08 + 08e)

- `Board/CardDetailView.swift`: a **"Champs personnalisés"** section (mockup 08) —
  grouped label/value rows, value shown, **"Vide" in italics** when `content`
  absent; opens the sheet (mirror `labelRow` → `.sheet`).
- New `Board/Sheets/CardCustomFieldsSheet.swift` (mockup 08e): same shape as
  `CardLabelsSheet` (`SheetHeader`, `presentationDetents`, `(cardId:, boardVM:)`) —
  one `TextField` per field grouped by group; on commit →
  `boardVM.setCustomFieldValue(...)`, or `clearCustomFieldValue(...)` when emptied.
  Footer: "Texte libre · 512 caractères max par champ."
- `Board/BoardViewModel.swift`: `setCustomFieldValue(_:groupId:fieldId:card:)` +
  `clearCustomFieldValue(...)` — exact mirror of `addLabel` (call client → mutate
  local `payload.customFieldValues` via upsert/remove → reassign → `catch { error }`).

### Part D — Board-level group management (mockup 05quinquies)

- Board-level sheet (from `BoardView` toolbar): toggle **ON** an inherited base
  group → `createBoardCustomFieldGroup` with `baseCustomFieldGroupId`; toggle
  **OFF** → `deleteCustomFieldGroup`; "Champs propres au tableau" → ad-hoc group
  (`name`) + `createCustomFieldInGroup`.
- `BoardViewModel`: `addCustomFieldGroup(fromBase:)` / `(name:)`,
  `deleteCustomFieldGroup`, `addCustomField(to:name:)`, `deleteCustomField`.

### Sequencing

Suggested PRs: **(1) Part A + tests**, **(2) Part B + tests**, **(3) Part C**,
**(4) Part D** (A+B and C+D can be paired into 2 PRs).

**Testing expectations:** unit tests for board-payload decoding of custom-field
groups/fields/values, the realtime reconciler for each event, and the view model
managing values on the card detail screen. Run `swift test` + `xcodebuild test`
before each merge.

**Suggested kickoff prompt:**
> Read CLAUDE.md and ROADMAP.md. Implement Phase 7 Part A (BoardlyKit foundation):
> wire custom-field groups/fields/values into `BoardPayload` (+ `Included` decode +
> accessors) and add the board/card `PlankaClient` endpoints incl. set/clear value
> (mind the `$` and plural/singular URL gotchas). Values are free-text strings — no
> typed inputs. Include unit tests per the "Testing expectations". Plan first.

---

## Phase 8 — Localization (i18n)

**Goal:** turn the shipped English UI into a properly localized app. Phases 1–7
were built with hardcoded French strings; those have since been translated in
bulk to hardcoded **English** (the new source language), but nothing is
localizable yet. This phase adds the internationalization infrastructure and
reintroduces French as the first translated locale.

**Prerequisite context:** all user-facing copy now lives as hardcoded English
string literals in the `Boardly/` app layer (BoardlyKit stays UI-string-free).
The bulk FR→EN translation is done; this phase is about *extraction*, not
re-translation.

- **String Catalog:** add a `Localizable.xcstrings` String Catalog; set the base
  (development) localization to English, which is already the project's
  `developmentRegion`.
- **Make strings localizable:** replace bare `String` literals in `Text(...)`,
  labels, alerts, accessibility strings, etc. with localized lookups
  (`String(localized:)` / `LocalizedStringKey` — SwiftUI `Text` already takes a
  `LocalizedStringKey`, so audit which literals actually resolve through the
  catalog vs. bypass it via `Text(verbatim:)` or `String` interpolation).
- **Pluralization & interpolation:** use the catalog's plural variants for
  count-driven copy (e.g. "N cards", "N cartes") rather than string
  concatenation; keep interpolated values (names, counts, dates) as format
  arguments so translators get correct word order.
- **French locale:** add `fr` to the catalog and translate every key back to
  French — the first non-base locale, and a regression check that no string was
  missed during extraction.
- **Locale-aware formatting:** route dates, relative times, and numbers through
  `Date.FormatStyle` / `NumberFormatter` with the current locale rather than
  hardcoded French/English formats (audit the Activity feed's relative-time
  buckets and any manual date strings).
- **Verification:** run the app under both the English and French scheme
  language options; confirm no key falls back to its raw identifier and that
  layouts survive the longer/shorter strings.

**Testing expectations:** unit tests asserting that representative keys resolve
in both `en` and `fr` (no missing-key fallthrough), that plural variants pick
the right form for 0/1/N, and that any locale-dependent formatting helper
produces the expected output for a fixed locale. Keep tests locale-pinned so
they don't depend on the CI machine's region.

**Suggested kickoff prompt:**
> Read CLAUDE.md and ROADMAP.md. Implement Phase 8: add a `Localizable.xcstrings`
> String Catalog with English as the base localization, make all app-layer UI
> strings localizable (including plurals and interpolation), reintroduce French as
> a fully translated locale, and route date/number formatting through the current
> locale. Include unit tests per the "Testing expectations" in ROADMAP.md. Plan
> first, then implement.

## Phase 9 — Catching up with the server (fields we receive and ignore)

**Goal:** close the gap between what PLANKA sends and what Boardly models. This is
not speculation: it comes from profiling two live instances (`pro.demo.planka.cloud`
and `community.demo.planka.cloud`) against every BoardlyKit model — 2 021 objects,
21 models, checked in both directions. Decoding itself is sound (that audit found no
remaining mismatch once the Pro personal-project fix landed); what it found is **48
fields the server sends that we drop on the floor**, each one a PLANKA feature the
app can't see.

Ordered by user-visible cost, not by size.

### 9a — Board membership permissions ⚠️ needs data before it can be written

`BoardMembership` carries `canCreateCards`, `canUseComments`,
`canSeeOnlyAssignedCards`, `canAccessInbox`, `canUseInbox`,
`canInteractWithGuests` and `hideIdentityFromGuests` — none of them modelled. We
don't read `role` for board members either, so a **viewer gets the same UI as an
editor**: the app offers actions the server then refuses with `E_FORBIDDEN`.

The trap: on both demo instances every one of those booleans is **null across all 78
memberships**, and the two editions don't agree on the field set (community sends
only `canComment`, which Pro drops entirely). In PLANKA, null means "the role's
default applies", *not* "denied" — so gating naively on `if !canUseComments` would
grey the UI out for everybody. Key the gate off `role`, and treat the booleans as
refinements only where non-null. **Don't write this without an instance that has a
genuinely restricted member to test against**: the demo data contains no example of
a permission actually set.

### 9b — Card features we don't surface

`startDate`, the whole recurrence family (`recurrence`, `recurrenceDueDateOffset`,
`recurrenceStartedAt`, `recurrenceDestination`, `lastRecurredAt`,
`skipDuplicateRecurrence`), location (`locationName`, `locationCoordinates`),
`isDraft`, `isSubscribed`, `coverLinkAttachmentId`, and the duplication trail
(`sourceId`, `sourceList`, `sourceLabels`). Recurring cards and card subscriptions
are the two users notice missing.

### 9c — Board features we don't surface

`notice` / `isNoticeEnabled` (a board-level banner), `isSubscribed`,
`displayCardAges`, `startWithEmptyBoard`, `type`, and the guest-visibility settings
(`canGuestsSeeOtherGuests`, `setCoverAttachmentsVisibleToGuestsAutomatically`,
`setCoverLinkAttachmentsVisibleToGuestsAutomatically`). `Label` has its own pair
(`canBeUsedByGuests`, `canBeUsedByWorkers`) and `Attachment` has
`isVisibleToGuests`: the guest model is a coherent feature we ignore wholesale.

### 9d — Account & instance

`User`: `isTotpEnabled`, `totpEnabledAt`, `totpRecoveryCodesRemaining` (2FA),
`department`, `location`, `autoLogoutMode`, `lockedFieldNames`,
`hideIdentityFromGuests`. `Bootstrap`: `instanceName`, `logo`, `loginCover`,
`organization`, `welcomeMessage`, `isDemoMode`, and **`maintenanceMode` /
`maintenanceMessage`** — that last pair is the cheapest win in the phase, since an
instance in maintenance currently just fails opaquely.

### Deliberately skipped

`Project.backgroundStockImage`, `backgroundFilter`, `backgroundFilterStrength` —
Pro-only background cosmetics with no equivalent in our design system.

**Testing expectations:** decode tests built from **captured live payloads**, not
hand-written fixtures — the Pro personal-project bug got through precisely because
the spec and the fixtures agreed with each other and disagreed with the server. Any
permission gating needs the three states covered (allowed, denied, and null ⇒ role
default). Re-profile a live instance before starting: the field list above is a
snapshot of 2026-08-25, and PLANKA keeps moving.

**Suggested kickoff prompt:**
> Read CLAUDE.md and ROADMAP.md. Implement Phase 9a: read board membership `role`
> and permissions, and gate the board UI so a viewer isn't offered actions the
> server will refuse. Treat a null permission as "the role's default applies", never
> as "denied". Include unit tests per the "Testing expectations" in ROADMAP.md.
> Plan first, then implement.

## Notes for every phase

- Always start with "plan first, then implement" — review the plan before
  letting Claude Code write code (Shift+Tab for plan mode works too).
- Run `swift test` before merging; use `/code-review` and `/security-review`
  before each PR, especially for Phase 1 (auth/Keychain) and Phase 5 (OIDC,
  admin endpoints).
- Update CLAUDE.md if a phase reveals a rule that should change (e.g. a new
  architecture decision) — keep it in sync rather than letting drift
  accumulate.
